This folder contains the script to release a public version of the Chest Imaging Platform, which kept private until January 2015.

Besides the script, it was needed to modify some files in the Release branch to eliminate the removed CLIs from the compilation. These files are also included in this folder (the original structure was kept, so you would need to copy the files in the root folder).
